      This little tool is a tiny thought experiment on ways to defeat netdecking, and given lesser used cards a chance to shine.
      Essentially, it is a tool to "bin" all MtG cards into groups, which vary based on the unique player identifier and a unique group identifier.
      (Although if you leave that blank it doesn't matter.) The idea is that each player has a unique cardpool, generated in this fashion, and that then they have
      to adapt to the cards that are legal for them, and that no one else has the same card pool to draw from.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a card name is given, the above tool generates a legality group number. This group number can be used in a few different ways. For example, players
      could either all be forced to use the same group number (group number 0), or every player could have to make a deck, where every card was from the same
      group number (for example, a player could use all cards from group number 0, or from group number 1)
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular I think this would be interesting in online constructed environments, where it adds another dimension to deckbuilding, and prevents anyone
      from showing up with a straight netdeck (most of the time). This also means that you might have to use less powerful substitutes for other cards.
